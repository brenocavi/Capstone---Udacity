INTRODUCTION 

With my final project in the Nanodegree Udacity, the of this project it was write a model using a CNN. This CNN must recevied an image and return with there is a dog and what is the breed of this dog, and in case an image of human is provided, the model must return that a human face that was recognized and provides to us what breed of dog is that human most like.  

STEPS

Step 0: Import Datasets

Step 1: Detect Humans

Step 2: Detect Dogs

Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

In a fast sequential line. To perform the analysis from the second stage, OpenCv was used, which responded well to human faces but to dogs. In step three, ResNet50 was used, where to build an architecture to work with dog data. And in the final step, using transfer learning I managed to reach an acceptable level of accuracy for the project. 

Results 

In the final CNN, using pre-trained Inception model in transfer learning to increse the accuracy, I got to achieve the mark of 80%
