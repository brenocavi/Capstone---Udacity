INTRODUCTION 

With my final project in the Nanodegree Udacity, the of this project it was write a model using a CNN. This CNN must recevied an image and return with there is a dog and what is the breed of this dog, and in case an image of human is provided, the model must return that a human face that was recognized and provides to us what breed of dog is that human most like.  

FILES

There is a Jupiter Notebook with all the code, that shows how a work with the almost 8700 dog´s imagens and almost 13400 human´s imagens 
In requeriment.txt there the libraries used in this project 

Results 

In the final CNN, using pre-trained Inception model in transfer learning to increse the accuracy, I got to achieve the mark of 80%
